"Roses are red, violets are blue, 
In this vast world, there's only one you."
"Twinkling stars in the night sky so bright, 
Guiding travelers till the morning light."
"A gentle breeze whispers through the trees, 
Carrying stories of the rustling leaves."
"The sun sets low with a fiery glow, 
Leaving behind the night's soft shadow."
"Waves crash upon the distant shore, 
Singing a melody of the ocean's roar."
